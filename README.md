# ingress-app

This repository contains a Helm chart with a Kubernetes ingress controller that is installed as a system add-on in [Gravity](https://github.com/gravitational/gravity) clusters.

The controller is based on the upstream [nginx-ingress](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) chart.
